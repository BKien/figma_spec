## Non-Use-Case Evidence

Foundation pages, component pages, generic tile-state galleries, progress indicators, and toasts support the specified flows but do not represent independent actor goals.

## Contract Completion — 2026-09-22

The 18 supported use cases remain unchanged in scope. Supporting session-state, chat-history and background-catalog read contracts complete their observable interactions. Internal role, identity, lifecycle, retry and concurrency decisions are explicitly recorded in ASSUMPTIONS.md. No new product screen is claimed by this revision. The tile-menu component distinguishes personal pinning from session-wide spotlighting; host transfer and stream restart after STOP are not added as supported flows.
