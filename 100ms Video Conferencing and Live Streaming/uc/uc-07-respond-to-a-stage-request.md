# UC-07 — Respond to a Stage Request

### Description

As a host, I want to accept or reject a viewer's stage request so that the viewer receives a clear participation outcome.

### Actors

Host; Stage Service.

### Priority

P1.

### Trigger

**TRG-UC-07-01** — The host opens a displayed stage request and chooses a response.

### Preconditions

- **PRE-UC-07-01** — The host interface displays a stage-request item.

### Postconditions

- **POST-UC-07-01** — The host and viewer interfaces display the returned decision outcome.

### Basic Flow

1. The host opens the displayed request.
2. The client presents the available response actions.
3. The host chooses Accept.
4. The client submits the response.
5. The system returns the updated stage request and participant representation.
6. The host client renders the viewer on the stage.
7. The viewer client requests session state and renders its returned participation state.

### Alternative Flows

#### AF-UC-07-01

1. The host chooses Reject.
2. The client submits the response and displays the returned rejected outcome.

### Exception Flows

#### EF-UC-07-01

1. The stage service cannot complete the response.
2. The client displays the returned failure state and retains the request item.

### UML Model

Classifiers and helper semantics are imported from the [shared domain model](shared-domain-model.md).

```plantuml
@startuml
class StageService {
  decide(command: StageCommand, session: Session, stream: LiveStream, request: StageRequest): StageRequest
}

### Notes

The shared model defines trusted context, persistence mapping, and query helpers. Server mutation execution uses MutationGateway and its common OCL constraints in UC-02. API command dispatch selects the named operation; it does not combine the preconditions of different operations. Read operations have no domain writes.
