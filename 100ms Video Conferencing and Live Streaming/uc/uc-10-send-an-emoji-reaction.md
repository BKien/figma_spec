# UC-10 — Send an Emoji Reaction

### Description

As a participant, I want to send an emoji reaction so that I can respond without interrupting the session.

### Actors

Participant; Collaboration Service.

### Priority

P2.

### Trigger

**TRG-UC-10-01** — The participant opens the reaction controls and chooses an emoji.

### Preconditions

- **PRE-UC-10-01** — The participant is viewing a joined-session interface.

### Postconditions

- **POST-UC-10-01** — The client renders the reaction event returned by the system.

### Basic Flow

1. The participant opens the emoji reaction controls.
2. The client presents the available reaction choices.
3. The participant chooses a reaction.
4. The client submits the reaction.
5. The system returns the created event.
6. The client renders the reaction in the session.

### Alternative Flows

#### AF-UC-10-01

1. The participant closes the reaction controls without selecting an item.
2. The client restores the session controls.

### Exception Flows

#### EF-UC-10-01

1. The reaction cannot be created.
2. The client displays the returned failure notice without closing the session.

### UML Model

Classifiers and helper semantics are imported from the [shared domain model](shared-domain-model.md).

```plantuml
@startuml
class CollaborationService {
  sendReaction(command: ReactionCommand, session: Session): ReactionEvent
}
@enduml
```

### Notes

The shared model defines trusted context, persistence mapping, and query helpers. Server mutation execution uses MutationGateway and its common OCL constraints in UC-02. API command dispatch selects the named operation; it does not combine the preconditions of different operations. Read operations have no domain writes.
