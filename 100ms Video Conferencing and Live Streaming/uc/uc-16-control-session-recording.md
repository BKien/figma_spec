# UC-16 — Control Session Recording

### Description

As a host, I want to start and stop session recording so that the session can be captured through the visible recording controls.

### Actors

Host; Recording Service.

### Priority

P1.

### Trigger

**TRG-UC-16-01** — The host chooses a recording action from the session controls.

### Preconditions

- **PRE-UC-16-01** — The host is viewing the joined-session interface.

### Postconditions

- **POST-UC-16-01** — The client displays the recording state returned by the system.

### Basic Flow

1. The host opens the recording control.
2. The client presents the recording confirmation shown by the design.
3. The host confirms the start action.
4. The client submits the recording-control request.
5. The system returns the recording representation.
6. The client displays the returned recording indicator and refreshes it from session state.

### Alternative Flows

#### AF-UC-16-01

1. The host chooses to stop the active recording.
2. The client submits the stop action and displays the returned stopped state.

### Exception Flows

#### EF-UC-16-01

1. The recording service cannot complete the action.
2. The client displays the returned recording failure state.

### UML Model

Classifiers and helper semantics are imported from the [shared domain model](shared-domain-model.md).

@startuml
class RecordingService {
  control(command: RecordingCommand, session: Session): Recording
  complete(command: ProviderCompletion, recording: Recording, session: Session): Recording
}

### Notes

The shared model defines trusted context, persistence mapping, and query helpers. Server mutation execution uses MutationGateway and its common OCL constraints in UC-02. API command dispatch selects the named operation; it does not combine the preconditions of different operations. Read operations have no domain writes.
